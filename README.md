# Flask-Cryptography
This project is a web application built using Flask, a Python web framework. The main focus of the project is to create secure digital diplomas for a school.

The application uses various cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the generated diplomas. It also provides a user-friendly interface for the school administrators to easily generate and revoke diplomas.

# Features
- Securely generate and issue digital diplomas using cryptography
- Revoke previously issued diplomas
- Easy-to-use interface for school administrators
- Built using Flask, a popular Python web framework
